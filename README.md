# Exotic Political Systems: Agent-Based Models

Agent-based simulations exploring unconventional governance structures through NetLogo. These models emerged from creative writing projects but aim to implement a rigorous evaluation of absolutely absurd systems (with Dragons).


## Technical Details

**Platform:** NetLogo 6.x  
**Language:** NetLogo modeling language  
**Dependencies:** Standard NetLogo installation (no extensions required)

Each model includes:
- Configurable psychological trait distributions
- Multiple visualization modes for emergent patterns
- Behavioral metrics tracking individual and systemic outcomes
- Parameter sweep capabilities for systematic exploration

## Usage

1. Install [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/) (version 6.0 or higher)
2. Open any `.nlogo` file in NetLogo
3. Adjust parameters using interface sliders
4. Click "setup" to initialize the model
5. Click "go" to run the simulation
6. Monitor plots and metrics for emergent patterns

For systematic exploration, use NetLogo's BehaviorSpace to run parameter sweeps across multiple configurations.

## Context and Origins

These models are based on governance systems from fiction featuring archetypal fantasy characters with a twist. I learned NetLogo specifically to test whether these fictional political systems would actually work as agent-based simulations (And have fun)

## Contributing

Contributions welcome, particularly:
- Extensions exploring additional psychological dimensions
- Integration with empirical data on real-world governance outcomes
- Comparative analysis frameworks for evaluating institutional designs
- Alternative exotic systems based on different psychological insights
- Refinements to psychological modeling based on updated research

## Academic Context

While these models emerged from creative work, I try to be as rigorous as I can in domains I am not an expert.
